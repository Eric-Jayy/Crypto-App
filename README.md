# **Cryptocurrency Rates Calculator** 
A crypto rates calculator made for the user to check at their earliest conveience the status of their favorite cryptocurrency. They can view what the currency has done over the last hour, day, or week.

## **Motive**
My reasoning behind this idea was that I work for a fintech company that supplies trading software for futures and options trading. We have recently expanded into the crypto market.
